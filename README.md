# Hacking Screen Simulation

This project is a visual simulation of a "hacking screen" using web technologies. It mimics the look and feel of a classic hacker terminal with multiple terminal windows displaying different phases of a hacking attack sequence.

## Project Overview

- The simulation consists of seven terminal windows displayed on the screen.
- Each terminal shows a series of messages representing different phases of a hacking attack:
  1. Initial Access & Reconnaissance
  2. System Infiltration
  3. Data Exfiltration
  4. Privilege Escalation & Persistence
  5. Covering Tracks
  6. Bonus malicious activities
  7. Final phase and completion messages
- Messages appear with a delay and include blinking dots to simulate typing or loading effects.

## Technologies Used

- HTML: Structure of the page and terminal containers.
- CSS: Styling to create a green-on-black terminal aesthetic with blinking dots animation.
- JavaScript: Controls the sequential display of messages in each terminal with timing and animation effects.

## How to Use

1. Open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser.
2. Watch the hacking simulation unfold across the seven terminal windows.
3. No additional setup or dependencies are required.

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: Contains the HTML structure with seven terminal divs.
- `style.css`: Styles the terminals and messages with a hacker-themed look.
- `script.js`: Contains the logic to display hacking phase messages sequentially with animation.
